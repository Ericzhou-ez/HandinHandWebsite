# Hand in Hand Website (https://handinhandbc.netlify.app).
The Hand in Hand website is a vibrant and engaging community of youths dedicated to supporting teen issues, particularly destigmatizing mental health.
Our mission is to destigmatize mental health issues and support underprivileged teens through education, community engagement, and accessible resources. The website serves as a central hub for information, resources, and interactive elements to engage the community and drive impactful change.
